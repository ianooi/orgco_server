Everyone is aligned and does what it takes to ship the product and acquire customers. Things become quite different as the company grows, first to a larger team and soon to many teams. 
Each team now own a smaller part of the whole, communication with the rest of the organisation is not as straightforward, and maintaining a holistic view of the product and all the moving parts becomes a challenge.</p>

<p>At this stage it may be tempting to adopt the organisation of large, traditional companies. But their process-driven approach, designed to repeat things that have found to work with little change, can be detrimental for a growing organisation still with many uncertainties.</p>

<p>Scaling companies need a flat organisation made up of venture-like teams. These teams are mission-driven. They work autonomously but are tightly aligned with the company and product strategy. They collaborate with other teams but have minimal dependency on each other. The benefit of this setup is multifold and can be powerful: team efforts are transparent and measurable; teams are motivated and innovative; and scaling can be done effectively with minimal dependencies and coordination.</p>

<h1 id="how-we-can-help">How we can help</h1>

<p><strong>Organisational structure.</strong> We optimise organisational structures for team effectiveness, from the leadership and management layers of the organisation to the individual teams. We look at the size and structure of the organisation and understand a range of factors including: company’s vision and investment strategy; product strategy; software architecture; and target customers. We then compare the organisation to what we consider as best in class and work with them to implement the changes.</p>

<p><strong>Organisational alignment.</strong> Good alignment comes from good communication which is an area most scaling organisations fall short on. Our aim is to help create communication channels that enable alignment across the organisation. Leaders maintain a holistic view of their product/s as the company grows and coordinate their teams to move toward the company’s mission. Teams have full awareness of the business objectives and context and are empowered to work out the best way to meet those objectives.</p>
