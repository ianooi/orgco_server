<p>At this stage it may be tempting to adopt the organisation of large, traditional companies. But their process-driven approach, designed to repeat things that work with little change, can be detrimental for a growing organisation facing many uncertainties.</p>

<p>Scaling companies need a flat organisation made up of venture-like teams, each with a mission. They work autonomously but are tightly aligned. They collaborate but have minimal dependency on each other. The benefits of this setup can be very powerful: team efforts are transparent and measurable; teams are aligned, motivated and innovative; and an organisation that is adaptable and scalable.</p>

<h1 id="how-we-can-help">How we can help</h1>

<p><strong>Organisational structure.</strong> We optimise organisational structures for team effectiveness. We look at the size and structure of the organisation and go deep into understanding a range of factors including the company’s vision and investment strategy, product strategy, software architecture, and target customers. We then help organisations understand the trade-offs of the design and build a plan to mitigate the effects.</p>

<p><strong>Organisational alignment.</strong> Good alignment comes from good communication, which is an area most organisations fall short on. Our aim is to implement communication channels that enable alignment in the organisation. Leaders can better coordinate their teams to move the organisation toward company goals, and teams with a clear understanding of the business objectives can innovate a way to meet them.</p>
