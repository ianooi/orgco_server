The subject can be fairly involved as it relates to other topics such as team autonomy and empowerment, organizational structures, and reporting relationships. For now, we’ll just focus on what OKRs are and their primary benefit of tackling one of the toughest challenges leaders face - organizational alignment.</em></p>

<p>OKRs stand for Objective and Key Results, it’s a goal-setting tool that, when used properly, helps companies get better organizational alignment, more transparency, and adopt an outcome-based approach to work.</p>

<p>An OKR consist of an Objective, which describes the goal you want to achieve, and Key Result, which measures your progress towards meeting the objective. The tool acts somewhat like a GPS.</p>

<p><strong>Objective</strong> is the destination - Where I want to be. For example:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Deliver quality leads cost effectively.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Key Results</strong> define how close you are to the destination - How will I know I’m getting there? For example:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Achieve cost per lead below $65 in Q4; and</li>
  <li>15% of leads convert to purchasing customers within 4 weeks of creation.</li>
</ul>

<p>OKRs can be implemented at different levels of the organization such as company, functional, team, and/or individual. At the team level, ideally cross-functional and end-to-end, each team works toward a common objective. The objective is set by the team, derived from the company strategy, and is designed to roll up to achieve the organizational objectives. Team efforts are then measured on business results, not output or tasks.</p>

<p><strong>Getting organizational alignment</strong></p>

<p>In a startup, even with undefined roles, it’s not hard to see how everything fits together. Everyone is aligned and does what it takes to ship the product. Things become quite different as the company grows, what were previously easy become increasingly difficult. Many leaders try to solve this by adding more management layers, increasing their physical presence in offices, and making use of video technology. These methods quickly disproved their scalability as the company grew, from one to many offices, and with different time zones.</p>

<p>With the right team composition, leadership and processes, OKRs can be an effective communication channel to achieve alignment by allowing:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Teams to focus on delivering business outcomes over outputs;</li>
  <li>Team efforts to be aligned with the overall organizational objectives; and</li>
  <li>Leaders to get a holistic view and line-of-sight on how teams are helping to push the company forward.</li>
</ul>

<p>Popularized by Google, most of the major successful tech companies have been using it for several years now, and it has started to spread to non-digital companies globally. While the concept of OKRs is quite straightforward, there are many different ways a company can implement it in the organization, and it can take a few quarters before its potential be realized.</p>
