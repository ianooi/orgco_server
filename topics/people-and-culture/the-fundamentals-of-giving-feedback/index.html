We’re afraid of hurting others’ feelings and then not knowing how to respond if they react badly. So when a fundamental part of your job, as a manager, is to give your reports feedback, you are doing what you’ve always avoided. But mastering this skill can help you overcome some of the biggest hurdles preventing your reports from doing great work and embed a learning culture in your team. Furthermore, while you may feel uncomfortable giving feedback, studies have shown most people actually want it, if given constructively.</p>

<p><strong>Set expectations upfront</strong></p>

<p>Imagine being asked to bake a dish you’ve never heard of or seen before. Should it look pale or golden brown? What about the texture and taste? To lay the foundation for any constructive feedback you and your report should agree on what success looks like - whether for a given project or for a given time period. Never assume your report knows what you want so set expectations upfront. Be clear on what great work looks like for them so they know exactly where to push and how hard to push. Also give advice that would set them off to a good start and address any common traps they should look out for.</p>

<p><strong>Transform in positive ways</strong></p>

<p>The best feedback transform people in positive ways, they inspire a person to do more of the good and less of the bad. So positive feedback are equally important as negative ones. Just ask any parent or pet owner, and they’ll tell you that positive reinforcement is more likely to create behavioral changes than solely focusing on the mistakes. There can be many tips and advice on giving feedback but mastering these fundamentals should already get you pretty far:</p>

<p><strong>Give often</strong> - feedback doesn’t need to start with a problem. If feedback is given only when there’s an issue, you’re probably not giving it frequently enough. Inspiring someone to transform for the better takes more than bi-annual performance reviews, so find every opportunity to tell them something useful - after delivering a presentation, aligning a bunch of stakeholders, resolving an issue with a difficult customer. It can be small like:</p>

<p><em>You dealt with the customer tactfully, your words showed your compassion which helped alleviate the situation quickly.</em></p>

<p><strong>Be specific</strong> - imagine after presenting a project proposal to some key stakeholders, your manager comments that “it was confusing”. You would be left wondering which part and how so. Ensure to give feedback without the recipient second guessing what you mean. Use examples to explain the why:</p>

<p><em>You dived into the details without giving any background. At the end, you showed the pros and cons of three options for next steps but didn’t tell us the recommended one. People in the room don’t have the background of the project like you do, so they were left confused about the purpose and way forward.</em></p>

<p><strong>Make them feel safe</strong> - recall the last few arguments you had with your partner or a family member, how often did they actually “listen” to what you were saying? As humans, when feeling threatened, our fight-or-flight instinct naturally kicks in and impairs our ability to process information to respond thoughtfully. So during those heated discussions, your message was unlikely to have gone through. When giving feedback, make the recipient feel safe. Show that you’re saying it because you genuinely care about them and want to see them succeed.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that everybody is different, so your tone and body language may need to vary from person to person. There will be some trial and errors and you will make mistakes along the way but that’s all part of becoming a better manager. Good luck!</p>
