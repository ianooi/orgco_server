As a manager, however, it is an essential part of your job so mastering this skill is crucial. Furthermore, while you may feel uncomfortable with giving feedback, most people want and appreciate constructive feedback.</p>

<h2 id="set-expectations-upfront">Set expectations upfront</h2>
<p>Imagine asking someone to make toast for you. Without setting expectations upfront, you might end up with something that is light brown, golden brown or borderline charcoal. Never assume your direct report knows what you want so take the time to get aligned on expectations. Be clear on what great work looks like so they know exactly where and how hard to push.</p>

<h2 id="give-the-positive-and-negative">Give the positive and negative</h2>
<p>Positive feedback is just as important as the negative. It provides the recipient with two channels of information to learn from instead of one. As such, positive reinforcement is more likely to create behavioral changes than focusing only on mistakes. Furthermore, logic suggests that most people would tune out if all they heard was negative things about them.</p>

<h2 id="give-it-as-often-as-possible">Give it as often as possible</h2>
<p>Inspiring someone to transform takes more than bi-annual feedback during performance reviews. Giving someone timely feedback at every opportunity helps them learn from it when it is most relevant. For example, after resolving a customer issue: <em>“You dealt with the customer tactfully. Your words showed empathy which helped alleviate the situation quickly.”</em></p>

<h2 id="intend-it-for-learning">Intend it for learning</h2>
<p>Imagine after conducting a presentation, your manager commented: <em>“It was confusing.”</em>  You would be left wondering which part and how so. The feedback that is given should always be intended for learning. For example: <em>“You discussed the pros and cons of the three options but stopped short of telling us the recommended one. So the others in the room were confused about how we are planning to proceed.”</em></p>

<h2 id="adapt-and-practice">Adapt and practice</h2>
<p>Keep in mind that everyone is different so your tone and body language will need to vary from person to person. There will be some trial and error and you will make mistakes along the way. But in your quest to become a better manager, your hard work will pay off. Good luck!</p>
