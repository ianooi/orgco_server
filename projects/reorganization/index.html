<p>A company in the health and wellness industry grew from a team of 5 to over 130 people. It was operating with several functional groups and layers of reporting lines. As the business expanded, communications were breaking down between the functions and delivery of new services were months behind.</p>

<h1 id="the-impact">The impact</h1>
<p>After a thorough review of the company, we decided a structure of largely cross-functional teams was more appropriate. We started the reorganization with a pilot team of five. Each member worked with high autonomy and was accountable for results against goals the team had set itself. The pilot team introduced a new service 40% faster than planned. Over the following weeks, we rolled out the new team structure to the rest of the group. After a period of adjustment, other teams also experienced similar time efficiencies. The high work autonomy also created a greater level of engagement among the individuals.</p>
